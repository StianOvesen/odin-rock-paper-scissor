# Simple Rock Paper Scissors
Rock Paper Scissors is a simple game that is played with two people. It is a game of chance that involves no skill or strategy.

To play the game, each player counts to three in unison and simultaneously throws one of three hand signs representing rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined by the rules:

- Rock beats scissors
- Scissors beats paper
- Paper beats rock

In this version of the game, you will be playing against an AI opponent. The first player to win 5 rounds wins the game.

To start the game, simply click on the emoji for "rock," "paper," or "scissors" and the AI will respond with its choice. The winner of the round will be announced, and the game will continue until one player has won 5 rounds.
